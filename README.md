Model car price prediction is the process of estimating the market value of a car using data-driven techniques. This involves analyzing various features of the car, such as its make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and overall condition. By applying statistical or machine learning algorithms to historical car sales data, the model learns patterns and relationships that influence car prices. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates for new or used cars, helping individuals, dealerships, and online platforms make more informed buying and selling decisions.

Technology used in our project are.
